# clinic36
A very close friend of mine (not named for the sake of their privacy) had a long history of drug abuse before seeking treatment at clinic36. I was so happy with my friend's progression to normality and sobriety, and often accompanied them to their doctors appointments and various other consultations with medical professionals. I was so happy, that I offered to redo the front end of their website; which in its current form, is incredibly outdated, and messy - a large quantity ofhtml/JS elements and animations overlap each other. After a conversation with some of the staff, and then email correspondence with the management, I offered to redo the front-end of their website completely for free, as long asI could have the files for the website in a private github repository. Despite the bad rap that opiate substition therapy clinics get, I saw my friend getting the very best of care from the various pharmacists, administrators, pathologists, and doctors at the clinic; and is now in fact weaning  You can visit their current website to know what I'm talking about:
https://clinic36.com.au/

Feel free to browse the website, though it is definitely very far from done. In addition, I have not created the 'treatment at the clinic' page. To browse the website, simply open clinic36-main.html in a browser of your choosing, or host all files locally using Apache or WAMP, being mindful of the fact that all <a href="xyz"> tags that make up the directory of the website at this point only open other .html files in the clinic36 folder. 

I still need to:
- Refactor my JS, perhaps even redoing all interactive elements in the GUI currently using CSS/HTML in reactJS
- Refactor/practice CSS hygeine 
- Create separate .js and stylesheet files
- As the website is a very rough draft so far, I need to prepare it for production, adding bootstrap code for all elements on the page for mobile compatibility
- Perhaps redo the whole thing with angular at some point, though when I started this it was one of my first websites, and didn't know how to use the angular framework.
